# Setting up NadekoBot with Docker

Hosting Nadeko v2 with Docker is not officially supported.  You can find the v3 docker guide [here][v3].
If you've been previously hosting with Docker on v2, please move to one of the other hosting options.
You may ask for guidance on our [discord server.][discord-server]
